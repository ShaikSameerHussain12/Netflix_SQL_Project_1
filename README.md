![](https://github.com/najirh/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

GROUP BY TRIM(value)
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CROSS APPLY string_split(N.listed_in,',')
GROUP BY TRIM(VALUE)
```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###10. THE AVERAGE CONTENT RELEASED IN INDIA ON NETFLIX IN EACH YEAR
```sql 
WITH total AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
    FROM netflix

)
SELECT 
N.country,
DATETRUNC(YEAR, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, N.date_added)) AS year_added,
ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100 / T.total_count, 2) AS percentage
FROM netflix N
CROSS JOIN total T
WHERE N.country LIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY 
N.country,
DATETRUNC(YEAR, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, N.date_added)),
T.total_count
ORDER BY percentage DESC
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT TOP(10)
TRIM(VALUE) AS ACTOR_NAME,COUNT(show_id) AS TOTAL_MOVIES
FROM netflix
CROSS APPLY string_split(CAST,',')
WHERE TYPE = 'Movie' AND country LIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY TRIM(VALUE)
ORDER BY COUNT(show_id) DESC 
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###15.CATEGORIZE THE CONTENT BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF THE KEYWORDS 'KILL' AND 'VIOLENCE' BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION FIELD. LABEL CONTENT CONTAINING THESE KEYWORDS AS 'BAD' AND ALL OTHER CONTENT AS 'GOOD'. COUNT HOW MANY ITEMS FALL IN EACH CATEGORY.
```sql
WITH TABLE1 AS (
SELECT *,
CASE 
	WHEN description LIKE '%Violence%' OR description LIKE '%Kill%' THEN 'Bad' 
	ELSE 'Good'
END CONTENT_TYPE
FROM netflix AS N  
)
SELECT CONTENT_TYPE,
